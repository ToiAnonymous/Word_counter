# Word_counter
This is a program that will ask you for a name that you want to use to create a file.
After inputing in the name, it creates a file with that name and saves it. It then asks the user 
to type in a text, which it will store in the file created.
After you are done typing in the text, it will automatically count the number of words and 
Show their frequency automatically. 
It then asks you for a particular word to find it's normalized frequency,
That is frequency of specified words divided by
Total number of words.
